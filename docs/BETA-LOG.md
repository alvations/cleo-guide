Append-only. One entry per session per wave: date, lane, session id, what changed, commit SHAs, screenshots.

- 2026-10-10 · PM (lead) · Wave 0 · session_01PCNcUkfa5S1N1BKGzZA4xx · Wrote `docs/BETA-BACKLOG.md` (M0 foundations,
  M1 "look like the leaders" ×21 items, M2 knows-you/shareable ×12, M3 on-the-street ×7, 9 deferred server-only
  features with honest alternatives, 6 live-pipeline requests LP-01…LP-06), `docs/BETA-DECISIONS.md` (D-01…D-31:
  Salon IA + new visual layer, keep "Cleo", light-first, sources as navigation, ribbon concierge, SEA pastel as a
  skin, computed day plans, no photos in M1 / Commons landmarks in M3 via LP-02, no analytics or affiliates in beta)
  and `docs/BETA-BENCHMARK.md` (hard gates G1–G8, measured rows B-01…B-45, teardown-matrix target, must/should/could
  coverage, finish line). Pilot set: Cleveland, Tokyo, New York, Singapore Chinatown, Wheeling, hub. No code or
